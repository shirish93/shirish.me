I am Shirish Pokharel. I am a Master's student at UMass-Amherst. My field of specialization is Security and Cryptocurrencies in Computer Science.
 <br><br>
I did by undergrad at Tufts University in Massachusetts. I majored in Computer Science and International Relations.
 <br><br>
I have worked for 2 years doing in various software engineering positions.
 <br><br>
Unlike Julia, whose blog inspired me to make this, my posts are more casual -- they reflect my thought process as I'm learning something new.
 <br><br>
I graduate from my program in Dec 2017 and am actively looking for jobs. 
If you want to hire me, email me at shirish dot pokharel at tufts dot edu.
