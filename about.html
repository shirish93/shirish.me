Hi, I'm Shirish Pokharel. I currently [as of September 2019] work as a Software Engineer at Solaria Labs. I enjoy working here, with smart, talented, and caring coworkers.
<br><br>
Before Solaria, I worked at a business automation startup in Downtown Boston. That's where I started learning Golang professionally.
<br><br>
Before that, I was a Master's student at UMass-Amherst in the Computer Science Department. My field of specialization was Secure Distributed Systems, and security in Machine Learning models.
<br><br>
I did my undergrad at Tufts University in Massachusetts. I majored in Computer Science and International Relations.
<br><br>

<h3>Social media:</h3>
<br><br>
<b>Twitter</b>: Surprising as it may sound, I do not have a twitter account. I do check some people's twitter accounts once in a while, but it's not for me.
<br>
<b>Instagram</b>: I do not have an instagram account, and have never had one, and am unlikely to have one. I do check up people I care about on instagram once a while.
<br>
<b>Facebook</b>: I got off facebook in early 2012 and currently have no plans to go back.
<br>
<b>Linkedin</b>: I'm not on Linkedin and have never been.
<br>
<b>Quora</b>: I'm not on Quora and don't plan on getting into it. The Shirish Pokharel in there is not me.
