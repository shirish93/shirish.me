Hi, I'm Shirish Pokharel. As of August 2020 I work as a Software Engineer at Solaria Labs. I enjoy working here, with smart, talented, and caring coworkers.
<br><br>
Before Solaria, I worked at a business automation startup in Downtown Boston. That's where I started learning Golang professionally.
<br><br>
Before that, I was a Master's student at UMass-Amherst in the Computer Science Department. My field of specialization was Secure Distributed Systems, and security in Machine Learning models.
<br><br>
I did my undergrad at Tufts University in Massachusetts. I majored in Computer Science and International Relations.
<br><br>
If you want to hire me, email me at shirish dot pokharel at tufts dot edu.

<h3>Interests:</h3>
I am an amateur novelist, and am working concurrently on several novels. I have ~60,000 words on my longest draft. It's pretty bad.
<br><br>
I like fermenting things. I have made over 30+ batches of kombucha. Other things I have made include kimchi (various kinds), 'kraut, sourdough, fermeted chilly sauce, rice wine, natto, tempeh. I plan on making meads next.
<br><br>
I consider myself an amateur food scientist, and have done non-fermenting food preservation projects too. As of late, I've been dehydrating everything and turning fruits and vegetables into edible chips.
<br><br>
I enjoy doing research on hindu myths and traditions, and the historical arts, sciences and technology in the South Asian subcontinent. 
<br><br>
I'm currently learning Go language. I consider myself a pretty good python programmer, and can make crappy POC apps in a couple of hours.
<br><br>
I like to bike, and my trusty cheapo folding bike has been my friend for the last five years. It's gotten me out of several tricky situations.

<h3>Social media:</h3>
<h4>Twitter</h4> Surprising as it may sound, I do not have a twitter account. I do check some people's twitter accounts once in a while, but it's not for me.
<br>
<h4>Instagram</h4> I do not have an instagram account, and have never had one, and am unlikely to have one. I do check up people I care about on instagram once a while.
<br>
<h4>Facebook</h4> I got off facebook in early 2012 and currently have no plans to go back.
<br>
<h4>Linkedin</h4> I'm not on Linkedin and have never been.
<br>
<h4>Quora</h4> I'm not on Quora and don't plan on getting into it. The Shirish Pokharel in there is not me.
