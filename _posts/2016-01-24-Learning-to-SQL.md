title: Rules are good: How I transitioned from a snotty petulant data archiver to a DB lover
---
I am sort of a data hoarder. When there's an opportunity to get access to datasets no one else might have, I go full-throttle with using my available resources to get them. For example, this weekend, I've worked done multiple latenights on collecting a half-million article big corpus of Nepali news articles. _Salvates_.

When you have a lot of data, you need to chuck it somewhere. When I'd just started programming, I would code up my own (awful, obviously), text file format, and store them using it. This led to (duhh) unanticipated annoying bugs that I would often have to work on for longer hours than the data collection itself.
