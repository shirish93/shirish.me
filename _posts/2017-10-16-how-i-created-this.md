Three months after buying the shirish.me domain name, I decided to make a good-looking blog. Since I'm a comically bad designer, I needed an inspiration. Fortunately for me, [Julia Evans's website](jvns.ca) was a site I regularly visited, so that's where I began.

I went to her github page first, and tried to make sense of the source code. I quickly realized that adapting just the layout of the site to my purpose would be much faster than trying to figure out the internals and change configuration according to my requirements.

I knew where I was hosting my site: at Github, since it provides free Jekyll hosting.
